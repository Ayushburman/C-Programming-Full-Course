# C Programming  - THE MOTHER
## Developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie @ BELL LABS

## How the machine breathes
- # The Problem
 - Computers were HUGE / EXPENSIVE / PROGRAMMED in Assembly language
 - we wanted SPEED / READABILTIY / PORTABILITY


-------------------------------------

 - BELL LABS was buulding new system called UNIX at that time but it was SLOW / HEAVY & HARD / PORTABILITY ISSUES
# So we needed language that talks to hardware but still thinks likenHUMANS


# EVOLUTION of C
MAchine Cde -> BCPL -> B -> C


## UNIX / LINUS kernel / Window Core / Embedded Sysytems / Compilers Database / drivers --- rewritten fully in C 

We're going to talk about the origins of the C programming language. Language was invented by Dennis Ritchie. Dennis Ritchie invented it 1972. Its purpose was to write an operating system. The operating system became so famous that we're still using it, it's called Unix, and while it was research which he conducted with Ken Thompson, because it was done at Bell Labs at that time, it was released as a free product. So people who wanted to use and effective at the time, small timesharing system or a system that let you have multi-user is on a small computer had many advantages, and it was just the era of the minicomputer was just starting. So people had very large computers like millions of dollars of big hardware from IBM or Burroughs. 
This wasn't how they were going to use their computer typically. Instead, this was for computers just being developed by places like Hewlett-Packard and then Digital Equipment. Later, the system becomes very important because [inaudible] used on small personal computers, and indeed it's the basis of Linux and is the under the hood mechanism behind the Macintosh Operating System. Very important. In fact so important are both Ritchie and Thomson won the highest award in computer science, which is called the Turing Award.

-----------------------------
## COMPILER
A compiler is a program that translates the entire source code at once from a high-level language into machine code (or object code).

Translation happens before execution

If there is an error → program will not run

Output: Executable file

### Languages using compiler

C

C++

Java (partially)

## What is an Interpreter?

An interpreter translates and executes line-by-line, at runtime.

No separate executable file

Stops immediately when an error occurs

Translation + execution happen together

## Languages using interpreter

Python

JavaScript

Ruby

# C Editor
## What is a C Editor?

## A C editor is a tool used to write and edit C code.

It does NOT execute code by itself.

# Examples

VS Code

Code::Blocks

Dev C++

Notepad++

### C is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that was designed for system programming and performance-critical tasks.

>> It is:

> Fast ⚡

> Close to hardware 🖥️

> Portable (runs on many systems)

> Powerful 💪

> C lets you control memory, CPU, and hardware directly, which most modern languages hide.

> So in simple words:

> C is a language that talks closely to the computer’s brain (hardware).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### ✅ History of C

### C was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs (USA).

> Timeline:

> 1️⃣ 1960s – ALGOL
→ Inspired many languages

> 2️⃣ 1967 – BCPL
→ System programming language

> 3️⃣ 1970 – B Language
→ Created by Ken Thompson

> 4️⃣ 1972 – C Language
→ Created by Dennis Ritchie (improved B)

> 5️⃣ 1973 – UNIX in C
→ UNIX OS rewritten in C (big breakthrough 🚀)

> This made C very popular worldwide.

>  Earlier, operating systems were written in Assembly (very hard).
C made OS development easier + portable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ✅ Why C is Called the “Mother Language”?

### C is called Mother Language because many modern languages are based on C.

#### Examples:

> Language	Relation with C
> C++	Extension of C
> Java	C-like syntax
> C#	Inspired by C
> Python	Uses C internally
> JavaScript	C-style syntax
> PHP	Written in C
> Go	Inspired by C

> So:

> Most languages “learned from C” → like children from a mother 👩‍💻

Also:

> If you know C → learning other languages becomes easy

> You understand how computers really work

> That’s why teachers and engineers respect C a lot.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ✅ Uses of C

### C is mainly used where speed, control, and reliability matter.

>> 🖥️ 1. Operating Systems (OS)

>> Most operating systems are written in C.

> Examples:

> Linux 🐧

> Windows (core parts)

> macOS

> UNIX

### Why C?
✔ Very fast
✔ Controls memory
✔ Talks directly to hardware

Without C → modern OS would not exist.

#### 🔌 2. Embedded Systems

>> Embedded systems = small computers inside machines.
> Examples: Washing machines,  Cars,  Microwaves,  Routers,  Medical devices,  Smart TVs

> These devices have: Low memory , Low power,  No heavy software

So they need lightweight + fast code → C is perfect.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 🛠️ 3. Compilers & Interpreters

#### Compiler = Program that converts code → machine language

>> Many famous compilers are written in C:
Examples: GCC (C/C++ compiler), Python interpreter, Java JVM parts

>> Why?
✔ C is close to machine code
✔ High performance

So languages are built using C.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 💻 4. System Software

#### C is used for:

> Device drivers
> File systems
> Database engines
> Networking software
> Basically → backbone of computers 🧠

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### 🎮 5. Game Engines & Graphics

### Many game engines use C/C++:

> Unity (C++ core)
> Unreal Engine
>Graphics drivers
>Because games need speed 🎯

<summary> Content here is inspired from the book "The c programmming language" by  Ben Kernighan & Denis Ritchie </summary>
1️⃣ Bell Labs Had Very Smart People in One Place

Bell Labs had around 1200 PhD-level scientists in one building.

They were all working on technical problems.

Everyone interacted and shared ideas.

👉 Result: Ideas spread fast.

2️⃣ People Were Given Freedom (No Pressure)

No one was told: “Do this project.”

People could choose their own work.

Once a year, they wrote one-page report.

That report decided funding.

👉 Long-term thinking, no daily pressure.

3️⃣ It Was a “Problem-Rich” Environment

AT&T handled phone service for the whole USA.

So there were millions of real-world problems.

Communication, networks, hardware, software, etc.

👉 Whatever you liked, there was a real problem to solve.

4️⃣ People Got Motivation From Feedback

Researchers shared work.

Others said:

“This is good.”

“But this part needs improvement.”

👉 This gave mental satisfaction (psychic reward).

Not money → respect & growth.

5️⃣ Bell Labs Was Part of the Academic World

They published papers.

Worked with universities.

Shared research.

👉 Not closed company → open research culture.

6️⃣ Stable Funding Helped Innovation

Every long-distance call paid a small fee.

That money funded Bell Labs.

So Bell Labs had:

✅ Regular income
✅ No fear of shutdown
✅ Freedom to experiment

👉 They didn’t worry about profits every month.

7️⃣ Interest in High-Level Languages Started Early

From MULTICS project (MIT + Bell Labs).

People realized:

Writing in high-level language is better than machine code.

So question became:
👉 “Which language should we use?”

8️⃣ PL/I Was Tried First (But Failed)

PL/I looked good in theory.

In practice → very complicated and bad.

👉 Too complex to use well.

9️⃣ BCPL Was Better

Created by Martin Richards (Cambridge).

Simple and clean.

Good for system programming.

👉 Much better than PL/I.

🔟 But BCPL Had Problems

No data types (typeless).

Modern machines had bytes, integers, etc.

👉 BCPL couldn’t fully use new hardware.

1️⃣1️⃣ Ken Thompson Created B Language

Ken made a simpler version of BCPL → B.

B was:

Interpreted

No compiler

No types

👉 Easy to use, but slow.

1️⃣2️⃣ Author’s Experience

He used:

PL/I → bad

Fortran → better

B → nicest so far

But B was inefficient.

1️⃣3️⃣ New Computer PDP-11 Changed Everything

PDP-11 was powerful.

Had proper data types.

So they needed:

👉 A language like B + types + compiler.

1️⃣4️⃣ Dennis Ritchie Created C

Dennis added:

Data types

Compiler

Efficiency

Result → C language.

👉 Fast + structured + portable.

1️⃣5️⃣ Portability Was Very Important

UNIX ran on many machines:

PDP-11

Interdata

HP

Mainframes

They wanted:

👉 Same C program → run everywhere.

1️⃣6️⃣ Making C Portable Was Hard

Some machines:

No characters

Word-based

Very different hardware

Making C work everywhere was difficult.

1️⃣7️⃣ Portable C Compiler (PCC)

Steve Johnson made PCC.

It separated:

Front-end → Understand C

Back-end → Generate machine code

👉 One language → many machines.

Big breakthrough.

1️⃣8️⃣ Author Wrote C Tutorial

He had written B tutorial.

Later changed it to C tutorial.

👉 Helped others learn C.

1️⃣9️⃣ Why He Loved C

He says C was good because:

✅ Matches human thinking
✅ Matches hardware
✅ Easy to understand compiler
✅ Efficient
✅ Expressive

👉 Perfect balance.

2️⃣0️⃣ He Pushed Dennis to Write a Book

Around 1977, he convinced Dennis.

First C book: 1978 (K&R C).

This became the most famous C book ever.

2️⃣1️⃣ Language Was Still Evolving Then

Structures were still being finalized.

Some features unclear.

But overall → solid language.

2️⃣2️⃣ 1988 Standard Was Major Milestone

ANSI C standard.

Unified version of C.

Stable.

After this → C became mature.

2️⃣3️⃣ After 1988, C Was “Complete”

He believes:

👉 By 1988, C was enough for most real work.

Later changes didn’t add much value.

(This is his personal opinion.)

# 📘 C vs Python – Basic Concepts Comparison

This document explains basic similarities and differences between **C** and **Python** for beginners.

---

## ✅ 1. Arithmetic Operators: `+ - * / %`

These are used for calculations.

In **C** and **Python**, they mostly work the same.

| Operator | Meaning   | Example                    |
|----------|-----------|----------------------------|
| `+`      | Add       | `5 + 3 = 8`                |
| `-`      | Subtract  | `5 - 3 = 2`                |
| `*`      | Multiply  | `5 * 3 = 15`               |
| `/`      | Divide    | `5 / 2 = 2.5 (Python), 2 (C)` |
| `%`      | Remainder | `5 % 2 = 1`                |

### 👉 Difference
- **Python**: `/` always gives decimal.
- **C**: `/` with `int` gives integer.

---

## ✅ 2. Comparison Operators: `== != < > <= >=`

Used to compare values.

Same in both **C** and **Python**:

| Operator | Meaning         | Example  |
|----------|-----------------|----------|
| `==`     | Equal           | `a == b` |
| `!=`     | Not equal       | `a != b` |
| `<`      | Less than       | `a < b`  |
| `>`      | Greater than    | `a > b`  |
| `<=`     | Less / Equal    | `a <= b` |
| `>=`     | Greater / Equal | `a >= b` |

### Result
- **Python** → `True` / `False`
- **C** → `1` / `0`

---

## ✅ 3. Variable Naming Rules

Format: `letter/underscore + numbers/letters/underscores`

Rules in **C & Python**:

### ✔ Can Start With
- Letter → `a`, `A`
- Underscore → `_`

### ✔ Can Contain
- Letters
- Numbers
- `_`

### ❌ Cannot Start With Number
```txt
2num ❌
```


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🔷 1. What is #include?

Example:

#include <stdio.h>


👉 #include is a preprocessor directive.

That means:

It is handled before the actual compilation starts.

So first:

Preprocessor → Compiler → Linker → Program


#include works in Preprocessor stage.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Meaning of #include

#include literally means:

“Copy the content of this file and paste it here.”

Yes — it is like copy-paste behind the scenes.

When compiler sees:

#include <stdio.h>


It replaces it with: All code written inside stdio.h.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What is # in C?

### In C, when a line starts with #, it means:

👉 “This line is for the preprocessor, not for the compiler.”

So:

" # = talk to preprocessor "
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🔷 2. What is Preprocessor? (Very Simple)

Think of preprocessor as a helper 🧑‍🔧 that prepares your code.

It:

✔ Adds files
✔ Replaces shortcuts
✔ Removes comments
✔ Checks conditions
" Before real compiling."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔷 5. What is stdio.h?

stdio.h = Standard Input Output file

It contains info about:

Function	Use
printf	print
scanf	input
" So when you include it, your program learns these functions."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✔ # → talks to preprocessor
✔ Preprocessor runs first
✔ #include → brings file
✔ Needed for functions
✔ < > = system
✔ " " = own file

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## In C Program Start with : main()
### CODE 

``` include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello\n");
    return 0;
}
```

<img width="335" height="154" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c93098fa-1277-4047-b61a-5efd7f648bc8" />

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Printing Output (print vs printf)
### Python
#Code

```
print("Answer", 42)

```
->Easy. Auto spacing. Auto types.

### C:

```
printf("Answer %d\n", 42);

```
-> In C, nothing is automatic. You control everything

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Input: input() vs scanf()
```
Python:
x = input()
``` 

-> Reads whole line.

```
C:
scanf("%d", &x);

```
